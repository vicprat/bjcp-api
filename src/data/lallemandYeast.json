    "yeast_description": "LalBrew Windsor™ is a true English ale strain that produces a balanced fruity aroma with lower attenuation due to an inability to metabolize maltotriose. LalBrew Windsor™ is one of the original Heritage Strains selected from the Lallemand Yeast Culture Collection when Lallemand Brewing was founded in 1992. Beers created with LalBrew Windsor™ are usually described as full-bodied, fruity English ales. LalBrew Windsor™ is a consistent and robust strain that produces moderate levels of alcohol and the balanced flavor and aroma characteristics of the best traditional English ales. Traditional styles brewed with this yeast include but are not limited to Milds, Bitters, Irish Reds, English Brown ales, Porters and Sweet Stouts.",

Advanced classical and non-GMO breeding methods were used to select a strain that does not consume maltose or maltotriose, resulting in very low attenuation. As a S. cerevisiae strain, LalBrew® LoNa™ performs like an ale yeast producing a clean and neutral aroma profile with no phenolic ­flavors, and significantly reducing aldehydes that cause worty ­flavors. Additionally, the patented technology from the University of California Davis (USA) ensures that the strain will not produce sulfurous off-flavors, allowing the malt and hop fl­avors to shine through.\nPasteurization is required when brewing with LalBrew® LoNa™ to avoid fermentation after packaging and ensure beer stability.",
